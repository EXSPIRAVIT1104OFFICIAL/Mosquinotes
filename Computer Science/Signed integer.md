# Definition

An integer consisted of the [[Binary number]] for the value with a [[Bit]] to define the sign.

# Notes

- The very first [[Bit]] will be the sign instead of being the place value, which `0` to represent positive and `1` to represent negative.

There are two other formats:
- [[One's complement]]
- [[Two's complement]]

For example:
`10100100` represents -36; the first [[Bit]] is `1`, so it's a negative number.
`00000101` represents +5; the first [[Bit]] is `0`, so it's a positive number.
