# Definition

An integer consisted of the [[Binary number]] for the value with a [[Bit]] to define the sign.

# Notes

- The very first [[Bit]] will be the sign instead of being the place value, which `0` to represent positive and `1` to represent negative.
- There are two other format of signed integers, which is [[One's complement]] and [[Two's complement]].

For example:
`10100100` represents -36; the first [[Bit]] is `1`, so it's a negative number.
`00000101` represents +5; the first [[Bit]] is `0`, so it's a positive number.
