# Definition

There is a [[Public key]] and a [[Private key]], one of which is used for [[Encryption]] and the other for decryption.

# Notes

- These keys are mathematically linked with each other.
- The sender encrypts the message using the receiver's [[Public key]].
- When the receiver receives the encrypted message, it uses its own [[Private key]] to decrypt the message.
