# Definition

The [[One's complement]] of [[Binary number]], plus 1.

# Notes

For example:
`10100100`, count from right to left, the first `1` is at the third [[Bit]], so the `100` should be remained and the other [[Bit|Bits]], which is `10100` should be switched to `01011`. `10100100` is converted to `01011100`, which represents -92 in [[Denary number]].

There is only one representation of 0, which is `0000`.
